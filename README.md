Project Name : Object Detection using Tensorflow 

**Introduction**
         Object classification is a critical task in computer vision applications. It is the 
task of classifying objects from different object categories. It is useful for 
Duckie bot to classify the objects in the received images and it can be helpful 
in tasks such as object detection and tracking. In Duckie town, there are 
many informative objects such as traffic signs, Duckie bot, duckies, house 
models, etc. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is one of the variants of 
neural networks used heavily in the field of Computer Vision
